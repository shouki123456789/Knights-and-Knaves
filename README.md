# Knights-and-Knaves
The solution to knights and knaves puzzles
## Overview

This project provides a Python implementation to solve Knights and Knaves puzzles using propositional logic. Knights and Knaves puzzles are classic logic puzzles in which characters, known as knights and knaves, make statements. Knights always tell the truth, whereas knaves always lie. The goal of the puzzle solver is to determine the identities of the characters based on the statements they make.

## Background

Knights and Knaves puzzles were popularized by logician Raymond Smullyan in his book "What is the name of this book?" published in 1978. In these puzzles, players are presented with a set of statements made by characters, each of whom is either a knight or a knave. The challenge is to deduce the identities of the characters based on the truthfulness of their statements.

To solve these puzzles, propositional logic is used to represent the statements made by the characters and the rules governing knights and knaves. Each character's statement is translated into a logical expression, and the relationships between the characters are modeled using logical connectives.
